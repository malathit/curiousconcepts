I have around 8 years experience as software developer.

I have always believed that you only know about something well, only if you can teach it to others. Also, I have always loved to teach my friends, colleagues etc. The result is this blog.

I write posts on the below topics
- Software development best practises
- Spring boot
- API development
- CI & CD
- Kubernetes
