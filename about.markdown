I have been having around 7 years experience in developing softwares.

Everybody gets the feeling of accomplishment, when they get their `Hello world!!!` program compiles successfully at the start of programming. However, this blog is more about the concepts/best practises, we encounter beyond the hello world.

I will write posts on topics such as 
- Software development best practises
- Spring boot
- API development
- CI & CD
