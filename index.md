Thanks for visting my site. I am a backend developer by profession. This blog is created with the intention of documenting my work. I will be glad if the posts help someone learn something. 

I post on topics that interest me. In this site you will find posts on,
- [Spring boot](/tags/#spring-boot)
- [Devops (CI & CD)](/tags/#devops)
- [Kubernetes](/tags/#kubernetes)

I :heart: open-source and I also contribute to open-source when time permits. [Here](/categories/) is the link to my blog posts.
